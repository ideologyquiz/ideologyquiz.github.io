                    <p>The Ideology Quiz is an attempt to go beyond the labels "left" and "right" in order to explore greater nuance in the political spectrum. It divides the compass along three dimensions: economic, government, and cultural. </p>

                    <h4 class="text-center">Economic</h4>
                    <p>The economic axis is likely the one that people are most familiar with. On one side of the economic axis are economic ideologies devoted to preservation of private property, most notably laissez-faire capitalism. On the other side, there are ideologies devoted to the socialization of private property, most notably socialism. My understanding is that as the economic axis is laid out, it puts ideologies like corporatism (not to be confused with corporatocracy) in the center, which some people may think should be placed on a "far-right" side of some sort. It's important to remember that this economic axis is not in and of itself supposed to represent the left or right. If left and right could be reduced merely to economic beliefs, this compass would be one-dimensional. Rather, the economic axis is simply meant to show the spectrum between laissez-faire capitalism and socialism. </p>

                    <h4 class="text-center">Government</h4>
                    <p>The government axis regards the degree to which the user supports large government, as indicated by centralization and control over various aspects of society. The peak of the government axis is a heavily centralized government, whether through totalitarianism or absolute monarchism, and the other end of the government axis is complete anarchism. The "centralized" side of the government axis should not be confused with simply "authoritarianism," which nowadays is a broad term that could cover many different ideologies, even ones that do not even consider themselves "authoritarian" at all. Meanwhile, the "decentralized" side should not be confused with libertarianism, which is also an incredibly vague term.</p>

                <div class="col">
                    <h4 class="text-center">Cultural</h4>
                    <p>Finally, the cultural axis regards views on morality. On one hand, there is more "traditional" moral systems, which consist of views that morality is grounded in religious beliefs, opposition to affirmative action programs,  etc. On the other hand, there are more "modern" moral systems, which consist of views holding morality is subjective, supporting freedom to choose abortion, etc. This might be the closest an axis gets to conventional views of "left" and "right," but even this is not a perfect representation. Some people might consider opposition to abortion to be a "left-wing" phenomenon since it used to be associated with progressives during the era of eugenics, or they might consider moral relativism to be a right-wing phenomenon because it is associated with the subjective value argument that many people use to support free-market capitalism. Regardless, this cultural axis still cannot be reduced to mere "left" and "right."</p>
